## Faircorp

##### This is an application to manage a smart building.

- The management of the users' health (COVID-19 pandemic, pollution), comfort, and energy consumption, require conflicting management of windows and heaters in public buildings. It is necessary to ventilate as much as possible because of the pandemics, but the weather is cold, and the heaters need to be turned on. So the building has a window opener device, a heater remote controler and some teamperature sensors.
- This applications allows the user to visualize the temperature of each room, the state of the windows and heaters. Also it allows him to controll both the heaters and the windows of each room.
